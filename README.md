Smart Bike Rental & Tracking System  
 Full-Stack Software Project | Node.js, Express, MongoDB | Deployed on Render

A complete **full-stack software application** for managing a bike rental system with multiple stations.  
Users can register, log in, view available bikes at each station, rent a bike, return it to any chosen station, and track their ride history.  
The backend is built using Node.js + Express, the frontend uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and all data is stored in MongoDB.  
The entire system is deployed on Render

 About This Project

This project simulates a real-world bike rental system with 5 predefined stations.  
Instead of external APIs or GPS tracking, bike availability and station updates are handled through backend logic and MongoDB collections.

It demonstrates full-stack software engineering skills including:
- Backend routing  
- Authentication  
- Database CRUD operations  
- State management  
- UI design  
- Deployment workflow  

This is suitable as a Software Engineering, Full-Stack, or Backend Engineering portfolio project.
