 About This Project

This project simulates a real-world bike rental system with 5 predefined stations.  
Instead of external APIs or GPS tracking, bike availability and station updates are handled through backend logic and MongoDB collections.

It demonstrates full-stack software engineering skills including:
- Backend routing  
- Authentication  
- Database CRUD operations  
- State management  
- UI design  
- Deployment workflow  

This is suitable as a Software Engineering, Full-Stack, or Backend Engineering portfolio project.
